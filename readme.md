# Low earth orbit visualizer

In C++ with OpenGL, everything from scratch.

- Read CSV data to get satellite info

- Implement the SGP4 algorithm to predict their motions
    - Test and benchmark against existing implementations:

- Do all of this optimally for all the satellites in real time

- Visualize them moving around the earth
   - Render the Earth realistically (wrap a heightmap around a sphere and texture correctly)

   - Show the trajectories of the satellites

   - Click satellites to show info on them

   - Filter satellites

   - Select specific satellites to track

   - Zoom camera in/out, orbit around the earth

- Add a button to zoom in on your GPS position and view the satellites overhead

- Low earth orbit: Orbit altitude of <= 2 km.
- Drag: An opposing force exterted by the Earth's atmosphere on objects orbiting in LEO.
- SGP4: Simplified general pertubations 4
- TLE: Two-line element set. Although it's the de facto standard, it's very outdated (Y2K problems, running out of satellite identifiers, etc), so instead we'll be parsing CSV

- The eccentricty of an ellipse is the distance between the two foci [-sqrt(a^2 - b^2), -sqrt(a^2 - b^2)], divided by the semi major axis.

- Periapsis: Point in an orbit closest to the center of mass of a system.
- Apoapsis: Point in an orbit furthest from the center of mass of a system.
  - Perigee and apogee are terms used specifically for Earth.

- Orbital node: When an orbit intersects a plane of reference to which it's inclined.
  - Ascending node: When the orbit intersects the plane of reference moving north.
  - Descending node: When the orbit intersects the plane of reference moving south.
